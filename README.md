# Reinforcement-Learning
Creating and testing out cool simple RL problems!

### Projects completed:
- [Blue Agent](https://github.com/MajesticKhan/Reinforcement-Learning/tree/main/BeautifulBlueSquare)
- [Lego Car](https://github.com/MajesticKhan/Reinforcement-Learning/tree/main/Simulation)

### In the works:
- Taking the simulated model and apply it to a lego car!
- creating value and policy iteration functions to find optimal policies given a defined Markov Decision Process
