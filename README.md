# Reinforcement-Learning
Creating and testing out cool simple RL problems!

### Projects completed:
- [Blue Agent](https://github.com/MajesticKhan/Reinforcement-Learning/tree/main/BeautifulBlueSquare)
- [Simulated Car](https://github.com/MajesticKhan/Reinforcement-Learning/tree/main/Simulation)
- [Lego Car following blue line](https://github.com/MajesticKhan/Reinforcement-Learning/tree/main/SimulationLego)
- [Value Iteration (In progress)](https://github.com/MajesticKhan/Reinforcement-Learning/blob/development/ValuteIteration/ValueIteration.py)

### In the works:
- creating value and policy iteration functions to find optimal policies given a defined Markov Decision Process
